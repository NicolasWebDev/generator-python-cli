# Generator Python CLI

A [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) generator for creating cli tools with python.

## Remarks

I use the internal `_folder_name`, which is set to the basename of the destination passed when generating the template, as the project name.

## TODO

- use the latest version of python automatically (maybe looking at https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-poetry)
- add more tools
- add tests
